Here Present you with a \emph{Method} of making \emph{Common-Places=},
for which I need make no Apology,
when I shall have told you that it was= writ by that Great Master of Reason and Method,
the late Learned Mr.\ \emph{Lock}.

I know very well that nothing of that Great Man's= can fail of meeting with a kind Reception from you,
who have so often expressed the Pleasure and Advantage you receive from his= \emph{Writings=};
and I make no doubt but this= \emph{Method} will have its= Share in your Esteem,
by being observed in the Future Course of your Studies=.

I shall forbear saying any Thing of the Usefulness= of \emph{Common-Places=} in General,
it being Foreign to my present Purpose;
neither is= it my Business= here to relate how favourably the Learned, both Ancient and Modern, have spoken of them, and with what Success= they have us'd 'em.

It will be abundantly sufficient towards= their Recommendation if I tell you that \emph{Tully} was= One among the Former, and Mr.\ \emph{Lock} among the Latter.

But I shall refer you to what I have extracted from the very Learned \emph{Monsieur le Clerc} concerning this= Matter.

It may be expected that I should give some Account of this= \emph{Method};
all that I shall say at present is=, That Mr.\ \emph{Lock} having drawn it up during his= Travels= abroad, communicated it to several of his= Friends=, who mighti ly importun'd him to make it Publick;
but he for a long Time declin'd it, (for Reasons= which you will find in his= \emph{Epistle} prefixed to this= Treatise) till at last, in Compliance with their repeated Requests=, he gave it to \emph{Monsieur le Clerc}, who in the Year 1686 Publish'd it in \emph{French}, in the Second Tome of the \emph{Bibliotheque Universelle}.

This= \emph{Method} having met with General Approbation from the Learned, I thought it a Pity that any Thing of Mr.\ \emph{Lock}'s= should be hid from any of his= Country-men, in an unknown Tongue:
I have therefore made it speak \emph{English}, and taken the Freedom of Dedicating it to you, with the Addition of Two Letters=, (because of their Publick Use) containing an extraordinary and most useful Method how to \emph{Teach} Deaf and Dumb Folks= to Speak and \VV rite a Language, invented by that Great Man \emph{John Wallis=}, Dr.\ in \emph{Divinity}, \emph{Geometry} Professor in \emph{Oxford}, and Fellow of the \emph{Royal Society}:
\VV ho, let it be Recorded to his= Immortal Honour, was= the First in \emph{England} that made \emph{Art} supply the Defects= of \emph{Nature}, in learning Persons= that were Deaf and Dumb to Speak and Write distinctly and intelligibly.
The Method that the Doctor prescribes= is= so Plain, Familiar and Demonstrative, that any Person of Common Ingenuity may attain this= Art with Ease, and abundance of Pleasure.

But I am afraid, Sir, I have been too tedious=, therefore I shall only add this=, May you go-on, as= you have already begun, to Cultivate a strict Friendship with Virtue and Learning;
and while many Young Gentlemen mind nought but the Gratifying their foolish Inclinations=, may you pursue the Ratio nal Pleasures= of the Mind, whose Fruits= are Solid Joy and Comfort;
in cited thereto on the one Hand by the good Example of your \VV orthy Parents=, as= on the other by that of your very Learned \emph{Uncle}, who so Gloriously Adorns= the Great \emph{Post} he is= in.

This=, Sir, is= the Hearty \VV ish and Desire of\\[\baselineskip]
