TO

Mr. Edward Northey,
OF

HACKNEY.

SIR,

I Here Present you with a Method
of making Common-Places, for
which I need make no Apology, when
I shall have told you that it was writ
by that Great Master of Reason and
Method, the late Learned Mr. Lock.

I know very well that nothing of
that Great Man's can fail of meeting
with a kind Reception from you, who
have so often expressed the Pleasure
and Advantage you receive from his
Writings; and I make no doubt but
this Method will have its Share in your
Esteem, by being observed in the Fu-
ture Course of your Studies.


Epistle Dedicatory.

I shall forbear saying any Thing
of the Usefulness of Common-Places in
General, it being Foreign to my pre-
sent Purpose; neither is it my Busi-
ness here to relate how favourably the
Learned, both Ancient and Modern,
have spoken of them, and with what
Success they have us'd 'em.

It will be abundantly sufficient to-
wards their Recommendation if I tell
you that Tully was One among the
Former, and Mr. Lock among the
Latter.

But I shall refer you to what I have
extracted from the very Learned Mon-
sieur le Clerc concerning this Matter.

It may be expected that I should
give some Account of this Method;
all that I shall say at present is, That
Mr. Lock having drawn it up during
his Travels abroad, communicated it
to several of his Friends, who mighti-
ly importun'd him to make it Pub-
lick; but he for a long Time declin'd
it, (for Reasons which you will find
in his Epistle prefixed to this Treatise)
till at last, in Compliance with their
repeated Requests, he gave it to Mon-
sieur le Clerc, who in the Year 1686
Publish'd it in French, in the Second
Tome of the Bibliotheque Univer-
selle.

This Method having met with Ge-
neral Approbation from the Learned,
I thought it a Pity that any Thing of
Mr. Lock's should be hid from any of
his Country-men, in an unknown
Tongue: I have therefore made it
speak English, and taken the Freedom
of Dedicating it to you, with the Ad-
dition of Two Letters, (because of
their Publick Use) containing an
extraordinary and most useful Me-
thod how to Teach Deaf and Dumb
Folks to Speak and Write a Language,
invented by that Great Man John
Wallis, Dr. in Divinity, Geometry
Professor in Oxford, and Fellow of
the Royal Society: Who, let it be
Recorded to his Immortal Honour,
was the First in England that made
Art supply the Defects of Nature, in
learning Persons that were Deaf and
Dumb to Speak and Write distinctly
and intelligibly. The Method that
the Doctor prescribes is so Plain, Fa-
miliar and Demonstrative, that any
Person of Common Ingenuity may
attain this Art with Ease, and abun-
dance of Pleasure.

But I am afraid, Sir, I have been too
tedious, therefore I shall only add this,
May you go-on, as you have already be-
gun, to Cultivate a strict Friendship
with Virtue and Learning; and while
many Young Gentlemen mind nought
but the Gratifying their foolish Incli-
nations, may you pursue the Ratio-
nal Pleasures of the Mind, whose
Fruits are Solid Joy and Comfort; in-
cited thereto on the one Hand by the
good Example of your Worthy Pa-
rents, as on the other by that
of your very Learned Uncle, who so
Gloriously Adorns the Great Post he
is in.

This, Sir, is the Hearty Wish and
Desire of,

Your Friend and most

Humble Servant,



Monsieur le Clerc's Cha-
racter of Mr. LOCK'S
Method,

WITH HIS

ADVICE

About the

USE

OF

Common-Places.

IN all Sorts of Learning, and especi-
ally in the Study of Languages, the
Memory is the Treasury or Store-house,
but the Judgment the Disposer, which
ranges in Order whatever it hath drawn
from the Memory: But lest the Me-
mory should be Oppressed, or Over-bur-
then'd by too many Things , Order and
Method are to be called in to its Assi-
stance. So that when we extract any
Thing out of an Author which is like to
be of future Use, we may be able to find
it without any Trouble. For it would be
to little Purpose to spend our Time in
Reading of Books, if we could not apply
what we read to our Use. It would
be just for all the World at serviceable
as a great deal of Houshold-Stuff, when
if we wanted any particular Thing we
could not tell where to find it. [1] It is
an Old Saying, That that is the Truest
Poverty, when if you have Occasion
for any Thing, you can't use it,be-
cause you know not where 'tis laid.
Many have Wrote much en this Subject,
and I have made Trial of them, but I
have never met with a better and more
easie Method, than that which I receiv'd
from a [2] Friend, and publish'd in French
some Time since.

[1] Columella out of Cicero, L. 12. Cap. 11.
[2] He speaks of this Method of Mr. Lock's.

And I have found, upon several Years
Experience, this Method, which is very
well adapted, not only to the Latin, but
also to the Greek Tongue, to be extraor-
dinary useful. Neither do I ever look,
upon my Latin or Greek Collections,
but I call to mind the Kindness of that
Excellent and Learned Person, who
taught me that Method.

At the Entrance indeed upon any
Study, when the Judgment is not suffici-
ently confirm'd, nor the Stock of Know-
ledge over large, so that the Student
are not very well acquainted with what is
worth Collecting, scarce any Thing is Ex-
tracted, but what will be useful but for a lit-
tle while; because as the judgment grows
Ripe, those Things are despis'd which
before were had in esteem. Yet it is of
Service to have Collections of this Kind,
both that Students may learn the Art of
putting Things in Order, as also the
better retain what they Read.

But here are Two Things carefully to
be observed; the First is, that we ex-
tract only those Things which are Choice
and Excellent, either for the Matter it
self, or else for the Elegancy of the Ex-
pression, and not what comes next;
for that Labour would abate our
Desire to go on with our Reading; nei-
ther are we to think that all those things
are to be writ out which are called Γνωμαι,
or Sentences. Those Things alone are
to be picked out, which we cannot so rea-
dily call to mind, or for which we should
want proper Words and Expressions.

For Instance, although the Story in that
Place of Virgil where these Words are,

Discite Justitiam moniti, & non tem-
nere Divos.

Being warn'd, by all these Things,
learn to do that which is Just, and
not to despise the Gods,

is worth taking Notice of, yet I would
not have you Write these Words down,
because there is Nothing in the Thing it
self, or in the Manner of Expression,
that is above the Reach of any Ordinary
Capacity.

The Second Thing which I would
have taken Notice of, is, that you don't
Write out too much, but only what is most
Worthy of Observation, and to mark the
Place of the Author from whence you Ex-
tract it, for otherwise it will cause the
Loss of too much Time.

Neither ought any Thing to be Collect-
ed whilst you are busied in Reading; if
by taking the Pen in Hand the Thread of
your Reading be broken off, for that will
make the Reading both Tedious and Un-
pleasant.

The Places we design to extract from
are to be marked upon a piece of Paper,
that we may do it after we have read the
Book out; neither is it to be done just
after the First Reading over of the Book,
but when we have read it a second time.

These Things it's likely may seem Mi-
nute and Trivial, but without 'em great
Things cannot subsist; and these being neg-
lected cause very great Confusion both of
Memory and Judgment, and that which a-
bove all Things is most to be valued, Loss
of Time.

Some who otherwise were Men of most
extraordinary Parts, by the Neglect of
these things have committed great Errors,
which if they had been so happy as to have
avoided, they would have been much more
serviceable to the Learned World, and so
consequently to Mankind.

And in good Truth, They who despise
such Things, do it not so much from any
greater share of Wit that they have than
their Neighbours, as from Want of Judg-
ment; whence it is that they do not well
understand how Useful Things Order
and Method are.

Mr. Lock's Letter to Monsieur Toi-
nard, containing a New and Easie
Method of making Common-Place
Books, an exact Index of which may
be made in Two Pages.

I Do at length, Sir, obey you in Pub-
lishing my Method of making Com-
mon-Place Books. I am ashamed
that I should be so backward in Comply-
ing with your Desires; but that which
you requested of me, seemed to me a
Thing so inconsiderable, that I thought
it not worthy of publick View, especi-
ally in an Age so abounding with Fine In-
ventions as ours.

You know that I voluntarily commu-
nicated this Method to you, as I have
done to many others, to whom I believ'd
it would not be unacceptable. It was
not then, as if I design'd it for my own
private Use alone, that I have hitherto re-
fus'd the making of it Publick. I was of O-
pinion, that the Respect which One ought
to have for the Publick, would not suffer
me to present it with an Invention of
so small an Importance; but the Obliga-
tions which you have laid me under, and
our Common Friendship, do not permit
me any longer to decline the following
your Advice. Your last, Sir, has wholly
determined me, and I believe that I ought
not to stick at the Publishing my Method
since you tell me that you have found
it very useful after a Trial of several
Years, as well as those of your Friends,
to whom you have Communicated it. It
is needless for me here to relate what
Profit I my self have reap'd by the Use
of it for above Twenty Years.

I have sufficiently Entertained you
with it when I was at Paris, about
Seven or Eight Years ago, while I might
have receiv'd great Benefit by your Learn-
ed and Agreeable Conversation. All the
Advantage that I aim at from this Wri-
ting is publickly to testifie the Esteem
and Respect that I have for you, and to
declare how much I am, Sir, Your, &c.

Before we come to the Matter in Hand,
it may not be amiss to remark that
this Method is put in the same Order
that the Collections ought to be put in. you
will perceive by the Reading of that which
follows what the Heads mean, which you see
at the Top of the Back of every Leaf, and at
the Bottom of this Page.

EBIONITES] In the Gospel of the Ebio-
nites, which they called the Gospel accord-
ing to the Hebrews, the History which
is in Matthew XIX. 16. and the follow-
ing ones, was thus alter'd; One of the Rich
men said unto him, Master, What good thing
must I do that I may have Eternal Life?
Jesus said unto him, obey the Law and the
Prophets. He answered, I have done it.

Jesus said unto him, go sell

Adversariorum Methodus, or the Method of Common Places.

I take a White Paper Book of what
Size I think fit, I divide the Two First
Pages which face one another, by parallel
Lines, into Five and Twenty equal parts,
with Black Lead; after that I cut them
perpendicularly by other Lines, which I
draw from the Top of the Page to the
Bottom, as you may see in the Table or
Index, which I have put before this Wri-
ting. Afterwards I mark with Ink every
Fifth line of the Twenty Five that I just
now spoke of.

[The other Lines are made with Red
Lead, but for Conveniency one may make
them with Black Lead, which is better for
Use than Red Lead.]

I put at the Beginning of every Fifth
Space, or before the Middle, One of the
Twenty Letters which are design'd for this
Use; and a little farther in every Space,
One of the Vowels in their Natural Order.
This is the Index or Table of the whole
Volume, be it of what Size soever.

The Index being thus made, I mark out,
in the other Pages of the Book, the Margin
with Black Lead; I make it about the big-
ness of an Inch, or a little bigger, if the
Volume be in folio, but in a less Volume
the Margin is proportionably less also.

If I would put any Thing in my Com-
mon Place Book, I look a Head to which
I may refer it, that I may be able to find
it when I have Occasion. Every Head
ought to begin with some Considerable
Word that is Essential to the Matter treated
of, and of this Word one must carefully
observe the First Letter, and the Vowel
which follows it; for upon these Two
Letters depends the whole Use of our In-
dex.

I leave out Three Letters of the Alpha-
bet as useless, to wit, K, Y, W, which
are supplied by C, I, U, Letters of a like
Power. I put the Letter Q, which is al-
ways followed by an U in the Fifth Space
of Z. By this throwing of the Letter
Q into the last Space of my Index, I pre-
serve its Uniformity, and do not at all
shorten the Length of it: For it very sel-
dom happens that one meets with an Head
that begins with Z U, and I have not
found so much as One for the Space of
Five and Twenty Years, during which
Time I have made use of this Method.
Yet nevertheless, if it be needful, nothing
will hinder but that you may put it in the
same Space with Q U, provided you make
some Sort of Distinction.

But one may, for more Exactness, assign
to Q a Place at the Bottom of the Index,
which I have done formerly.

When I meet with any thing worth put-
ting into my Common-Place-Book, I pre-
sently look for a proper Head. Suppose,
for Example, the Head were Epistle; I
look in the Index the First Letter with
the Vowel that follows, which in this
Case are E I. If there is found any Num-
ber in the Space marked E I, that shows
me the Space design'd for Words which
begin with E, and whose Vowel that im-
mediately follows is I, I must refer to
the Word Epistle in that Page what I
have to take notice of. I Write the Head
in pretty large Letters, so that the princi-
pal Word is found in the Margin, and I
continue the Line in writing on what I
have to remark. I constantly observe this
Method, that nought but the Head appear
in the Margin, and go on without carrying
the Line again into the Margin. When
one has thus preserv'd the Margin clear,
the Heads present themselves at First Sight

If in the Index I find no Number in the
Space E I, I look in my Book the First
Backside of the Page that I find blank,
which Backside in a Book where there is
nothing else but the Index, must be the
Second Page.

I write then in my Index after E I the
Number 2, and the Head EPISTLE at
the Top of the Margin of the Second
Page, and all that is to be put under this
Head in the same Page, as you see I have
done in the Second Page of this Writing.

Since the Class E I. does solely take up
the Second and Third Page, one may make
Use of those Pages only for Words which
begin, with E, and whose next Vowel is I,
as Epicurus, Ebionites [1], Epigram, Edict, &c.

[1] See the Bottom of the Third Page.

The Reason why I always begin at the
Top of the Back of the Page, and that I
assign to one Class the Two Pages which
face one another, rather than a whole Leaf,
is that the Heads of this Class may appear
all at once, otherwise you must be at the
Trouble of turning over the Leaf.

Whensoever I would write a new Head,
in my Common-Place-Book, I look present-
ly in my Index for the Characteristick Let-
ters of the Word, and I see by the Num-
ber which follows them where the Page
assign'd to the Class of this Head is. But
if there be no Number to be found, I must
look the First Back of the next Blank Page.
I mark its Number in the Index, and so
I preserve this Page, with the Right Side
of the following Leaf for this new Class.
Let the Word be for Example Adversaria,
if I see no Number in the Space A E, I look
the First Empty Back of a Leaf, which
finding in the Fourth Page, I put in the
Space A E the Number 4, and in the 4th
Page the Head Adversaria, with all that
ought to be put under this Head, as I have
already done.

After that, this Fourth Page with the
Fifth that follows it, is reserv'd for
the Class A E; that is to say for
Heads which begin with A and where
the following Vowel in the Word is E,
as Agesilaus, Acheron, Anger, &c.

When the Two Pages design'd for
this Head are quite full, then look for
the Back of the next Blank Page: If
it is that which immediately follows,
I write at the Bottom of the Margin
in the Page that I have last
filled up, the Letter V, that is Verte,
Turn over; and likewise at the Top of
the Page following. If the Pages which
immediately follow are already taken
up by other Classes, I write at the Bot-
tom of the Page last filled up the Num-
ber of the next Back of the Page. I
set down again the Head of which it
treats under which I go on to write
what I have to put into my Common-
Place-Book, as if it were in the same
Page. At the Top of this new Back I
set down also the Number of the Page
which has been last filled up. By these
Numbers, which refer to one another,
the 1st of which is at the End of one Page,
and the 2d at the Beginning of another,
one reads the Matter which is separa-
ted as well as if there was nothing be-
tween them. For by this Reciprocal
Reference of Numbers, one turns over
as one Leaf all those Which are between
them, as if they were join'd together.
You have an Example of it in the
Third and Fourteenth Pages.

Every Time I put a Number at the
Bottom of a Page, I put it also in the
Index; but when I put only V, I make
no Alteration in the Index; the Reason
of which you will learn by Use.

If the principal Word of the Head
be a Monosyllable, (or a Word of One
Syllable) and begins with a Vowel, this
Vowel is at the same Time both the
First Letter of the Word, and the Cha-
racteristick Vowel; so I write the Word
Art in A a, and Elf in E e.

It may be seen by what I have said,
that one is to begin to write every Class
of Words on the Back of the Page;
It may from thence happen that the
Backs of all the Pages may be full,
while there may be [1] Right Sides enough
which do yet remain empty. If you
have a Mind then to fill up the Book,
you may assign these Right Sides, which
are yet entirely blank, to new Classes.

[1] See the Fifteenth, Seventeenth and Nineteenth Pages, &c.

If any one thinks that these Hundred
Classes are not sufficient to take in all
Sorts of Subjects without Confusion, he
may, following the same Method, in-
crease the Number to Five Hundred, by
adding a Vowel. But having try'd both
the one and the other Method; I pre-
fer the former, and Use will convince
those that shall make Tryal of it that
it is sufficient for all Subjects, especial-
ly if they have a Book for every Sci-
ence, in which they make their Colle-
ctions, or at least Two, for the Two
Heads to which we may refer all our
Knowledge, to wit, Moral and Natu-
ral Philosophy.

One may also add to them a Third
Book, which you may call the Science,
or Knowledge of Signs,which respects the
Use of Words, and is of far larger Ex-
tent than the Ordinary Critical Art.

As for the Language in which one
ought to express the Titles, I believe the
Latin Tongue to be the most Conveni-
ent, provided one always observes the
Nominative Case, least in Dissyllables,
(or Words of Two Syllables) or in
Monosyllables which begin with a Vow-
el, the Change, which happens in the Ob-
lique Cases should cause Confusion. But
it does not much matter what Language
you make Use of, provided you do not
mix the Heads of different Languages
together.

To remark a Place in an Author from
whom I would collect any Thing I
make use of this Method: Before I
write down any thing I put the Name
of my Author in my Common-Place-
Book, and under that Name, the Title
of the Treatise I am reading, the Vo-
lume, the Time and Place of the Edi-
tion, and (what ought never to be o-
mitted) the Number of the Pages that
the whole Book contains. For Exam-
ple, I put in the Class M. A. Mar-
shami Canon Chronicus, Aegyptiacus,
Graecus, & Disquisitiones, Fol. Lond.
1672, p.626. This Number of the
Pages serves me for the future to mark
the Particular Treatise of the Author,
and the Edition that I make use of. I
have no more Need to mark the Place
otherwise, than by putting in the Num-
ber of the Page from whence I have
Collected what I have writ over the
Number of the Pages of the whole Vo-
lume. You will see an Example of it
in Acherusia, where the Number 259
is over the Number 626, that is to say,
the Number of the Pages where the Place
is that is treated of, over the Number
of the Pages of all the Volume. So I not
only avoid the Trouble of writing Ca-
non, &c. but I can also, by the Help of
the Rule of Three, find the same Passage
in any other Edition whatever, by look-
ing the Number of Pages that the Edi-
tion I have not made use of contains;
since the Edition which I have used ha-
ving 626 Pages, hath given me 259. I
confess one does not always hit upon
the very Page, because of the Spaces
which may be made in different Editi-
ons, which are not always propor-
tionably equal; but nevertheless you are
never very far off of the Page; and it is
much better to find out the Passage with-
in some few Pages of the Place, than to
be at the Trouble of turning over the
whole Book to find it; as you must
do if the Book has no Index, or where
the Index is not very correct

ACHERUSIA.] Pratum, ficta mortu-
orum Habitatio est Locus prope Mem-
phim, juxta Paludem, quam vocant Ache-
rusiam, &c. This is a Passage taken out
of the First Book of Diodorus Siculus,
the Sense of which is this: The Fields,
where they feign the Habitation of the
Dead to be, is a Place not far from
Memphis, near the Marsh called Ache-
rusia, where there are most Delightful
Fields, with Lakes and Woods of Lotus
and Calamus.

It is not without Reason then that
Orpheus says the Dead inhabit those
Places, because it is there that the most
and greatest Funeral Solemnities of the
Aegyptians are Celebrated; they carry
the Dead over the River Nile, and the
Marsh Acherusia, and lay them in Sub-
terraneous Vaults.

There are other Stories among the
Grecians concerning the Shades below,
which are very like those Stories which
are invented at this Day in Aegypt. For
they call the Boat which carries over the
Dead Daris, and a Piece of Money is
given to the Waterman for his Passage,
whose Name in the Language of that
Country is called Charon. Not far from
this Place there is the Temple of
Gloomy Hecate, also the Gates of Cocy-
tus and Lethe, shut up with great Bra-
zen Bars; there are also other Gates,
called the Gates of Truth, before which
stands the Statue of Justice without an
Head. Marsham 259/626.

EBIONITES.] Sell all that thou hast,
and give it to the Poor, then come and
follow me: But at that the Rich Man be-
gan to scratch his Head, and was not at
all pleas'd with the Advice that Jesus
gave him. And the Lord said unto him,
how say you I have fulfilled the Law and
the Prophets, since it is written in the
Law, thou shalt love thy Neighbour as
thy self; and lo there are many of thy
Brethren, the Children of Abraham, who
have bad Raiment, and die with Hunger,
while no Help is administred to them
from you, tho' your House abounds with all
Good Things? And having turn'd to Si-
mon, his Disciple, who sat next him, Si-
mon, thou Son of Johanna, said he, it
is easier for a Camel to go through the
Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man
to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
Ebion alter'd this Passage of the Gospel
because he did not acknowledge Christ
to be the Son of God, nor a Law-giver,
but a bare Interpreter of the Law which
was given by Moses. Grotius 336/1060.

in Lib. ad Constantium Augustum. Basil.
1570, Fol. It is a Thing both Deplora-
ble and Dangerous, that there are now
as many Confessions of Faith as there
are Wills, as many Opinions as Incli-
nations, and as many Sources of Blas
phemy as there are Vices, whilst we
make as many Confessions of Faith as we
please, and Gloss upon them as we think
fit. And as there is but One God, One
Lord, and One Baptism, so there is but
One Faith, which One Faith we Re-
nounce when we make many different
Confessions; and certainly this Diversi-
ty is the Cause that there is no more
true Faith to be found. We are con-
vinc'd, that after the Council at Nice
there was nothing, either on one Side
or t'other, but writing Confessions of
Faith. And while they contend about
Words, while they debate about Novel
Questions, while they dispute about E-
quivocal Terms, while they complain
of Authors, while every Body endea-
vours to advance his own Party, while
no one can agree,


HERETICKS.] Let those Persons rigo-
rously treat you, who know not how many
Sighs and Groans it costs before one can
attain to any small Knowledge of the
Divine Being. Finally, let those Per-
sons rigorously treat you, who were ne-
ver seduc'd by such Errors as they see
you have been deceiv'd by. I pass by
that most pure Wisdom, to the Know-
ledge of which very few Spiritual Per-
sons arrive at in this Life; yet although
they know it but in very small Measure,
because they are Men, yet they know
it without doubting. For in the Catho-
lick Church it is not Penetration of
Wit, nor Depth of Knowledge, but the
Simplicity of the Faith, which makes
People sure and safe.

Barbari quippe homines Romanae, imo
potius humanae eruditionis expertes, qui
nihil omnino sciunt, nisi quod a Doctori-
bus suis audiunt; quod audiunt hoc se-
quuntur, &c. Salvianus 162/339. The Sense
of which take as follows. This Bishop
speaking of the Arian Goths and Van-
dals, They are a Barbarous People,
says he, who have not any Taste of the
Roman Learning, and who are ignorant
even of those Things with which almost
all the rest of Mankind are acquainted;
they know nothing but what they have
learnt from their Doctors, and mind
nothing but what they have heard from
them. Whence People so ignorant as
these are, find themselves under a Ne-
cessity of learning the Mysteries of the
Gospel, rather from the Instructions
which are given them, than from the
Reading of Books, therefore the Tra-
dition and received Doctrine of their
Masters are the only Rule that they
follow, because they know nothing but
what they have taught 'em. They are
Hereticks, but they know not that they are
so. They are so indeed in our Esteem,
but they don't at all believe it; yea, on
the contrary, they reckon themselves to
be true Catholicks, and Brand us with
the Title of Hereticks. They judge
therefore of us just as we do of them.
We are persuaded with our selves that
they do Wrong to the Divine Generati-
on, in maintaining the Son to be inferiour
to the Father. They imagine that we
derogate from the Glory of the Father
because we believe them to be Equal.
The Truth is on our Side, but they pre-
tend it is on theirs. We give all due
Honour to God, and they think that
their Belief tends more to the Honour
of God than ours. They are wanting
in their Duty to God, but this they
count the highest Duty of Religion;
and they make true Piety to conflict in
that which we have a quite contrary O-
pinion of. They are then in an Error,
but yet they are Sincere; and it proceeds
not from an Hatred, but Love of God.

HERETICKS.] For they pretend that
by it they do better testifie the Respect
they have for God, and their Zeal for
His Glory. Therefore although they
have not a right Faith, yet they never-
theless look upon it as a perfect Love
of God. How these Persons will be
punished for their Errors at the Day of
Judgment the great Judge of the Uni-
verse alone knows. In the mean Time
I believe that God exercises his Patience
towards them, because he sees that their
Heart is more right than their Faith;
and that when they do deceive them-
selves, it is an Affection for Piety that
is the Cause of their Error.

CONFESSION OF FAITH.] While no
one can agree, while they Anathema-
tize one another, there is scarce any that
sticks close to Jesus Christ. What Change
was there in the Confession of Faith but
last Year? The First Synod of the Ni-
cene Council ordains that nothing should
be said concerning the Homousion; the
Second orders and ordains that they
should speak of it; the Third excuses
the Fathers of the Council, and pretends
that they took the Word Ousia simply;
lastly, the Fourth, instead of excusing,
condemns 'em. As to the Resemblance
of the Son with his Father, which is the
Confession of Faith of these unhappy
Times, they dispute whether he is like
in the Whole, or only in Part. Behold
what Fine Inquirers these are into the Se-
crets of Heaven! In the mean while,
it is upon the Account of these Confes-
sions of Faith about the invisible Myste-
ries, and about our Faith in God, that
we thus Calumniate one another. We
make Confessions every Year, and also
every Month; we Repent of what we
have done, we Defend those that Repent
of 'em, and afterwards Anathematize
those We have defended: So we Con-
demn either the Opinions of others in
our selves, or our own Opinions in o-
thers; and in thus Tearing one another
to Pieces, we have been the Cause of
each other's Ruin.

FINIS


A Letter of Doctor John Wallis to Ro-
bert Boyle, Esq; concerning the said
Doctors Essay of Teaching a Person
Dumb and Deaf to Speak, and to
Understand a Language; together
with the Success thereof, made appa-
rent to his Majesty, the Royal Society,
and the University of Oxford.

SIR,

I Did acquaint you a while since, That
(beside the Consideration of .......,
which I had in Hand) I had under-
taken another Task, (almost as Hard as
to make Mr. ....... understand Reason) to
Teach a Person Dumb and Deaf, to Speak,
and to Understand a Language. Of which if
he could do either, the other would be more
easie; but his knowing neither makes
both harder: And tho' the former may
be thought the more difficult, the latter
may perhaps require as much of Time.
For if a considerable Time be requisite,
for him that can speak One, to learn a Se-
cond Language, much more for him that
knows None, to learn the First.

I told you in my last, that my Mute was
now at least Semivocalis; whereof because
you desire a more particular Information,
I thought my self oblig'd to give you this
brief Account of that whole Affair, that
you may at once perceive, as well upon
what Considerations I was induced to At-
tempt that Work, and what I did propose
to my self as Feasible therein, as what
Success had hitherto attended that Essay.

The task t self consists of Two Very
different Parts, each of which doth render
the other more difficult. For, beside that
which appears upon the First View, to
teach a Person who cannot Hear to Pro-
nounce the Sound of Words; there is that
other, of teaching him to Understand a
Language, and know the Signification of
those Words whether Spoken or Written,
whereby he may both express his own
Sense, and understand the Thoughts of o-
thers without which latter, that former
were only to speak like a Parrot, or to
write; like a Scrivener, who understanding
no Language but English, transcribes a
Piece of Latin, Welsh, or Irish; or like a
Printer of Greek or Arabick, who knows
neither the Sound nor Signification of what
he Printeth.

Now though I did not apprehend ei-
ther of these impossible; yet, that each
of them doth render the other more hard,
was so obvious as that I could not be igno-
rant of it. For how easily the Understand-
ing of a Language is attain'd by the Bene-
fit of Discourse we see every Day; not
only in those, who knowing One
Language already, are now to learn a Se-
cond, but (which doth more resemble
the present Case) in Children, who as yet
knowing none, are now to learn their First
Language.

For it is very certain, that no Two Lan-
guages can be so much different the one
from the other, but that the Knowledge of
the one will be subservient to the Gaining
of the other; not only because there is
now a Common Language, wherein the
Teacher may Interpret to the Learner the
Signification of those Words and Notions
which he knows not, and express his own
Thoughts to him; but likewise (which
is very considerable) because the Common
Notions of Language , wherein all or most
Languages do agree, and also so many of
the Particularities thereof as are common
to the Language he knows already, and
that which he is to learn, (which will be
very many) are already known; and
therefore a very considerable part already
dispatch'd of that Work, which will be
necessary for the Teaching of a First Lan-
guage to him who as yet knows none.

But to this Disadvantage (of teaching
a First Language) when that of Deafness
is superadded it must needs augment the
Difficulty; since it is manifestly evident
from Experience, that the most Advantag-
geous Way of Teaching a Child his First
Language is that of Perpetual Discourse;
not only what is particularly address'd to
himself, as well in pleasing Divertise-
ments, or delightful Sportings, (and
therefore insinuates itself without any irk-
some or tedious Labour) as what is direct-
ly intended for his more serious Infor-
mation: But that Discourse also which
passeth between others, where, without
Pains or Study, he takes Notice of what
Actions in the Speaker do accompany such
Words, and what Effects they do produce
in those to whom they are directed; which
doth, by Degrees, insinuate the Intendments,
of those Words.

And as that Deafness makes it the more
difficult to teach him a Language, so on
the other Hand that Want of Language
makes it more hard to teach him how to
speak or pronounce the Sounds. For there
being no other Way to direct his Speech,
than by teaching him how the Tongue,
the Lips, the Palate, and other Organs of
Speech are to be apply'd and mov'd in the
Forming of such Sounds as are required;
to the End that he may, by Art, pronounce
those Sounds which others do by Custom,
they know not how. It may be thought
hard enough to express in Writing, even
to one who understands it very well, those
very Nice Curiosities and Delicacies of Mo-
tion, which must be observed (though
we heed it not) by him, who without
Help of his Ear to guide his Tongue, shall
form that Variety of Sounds we use in
Speaking: Many of which Curiosities
are so Nice and Delicate, and the Diffe-
rence in Forming those Sounds so very Sub-
tile, that most of our selves, who pro-
nounce them every Day, are not able,
without a very Serious Consideration, to
give an Account by what Art or Motion
our selves form them; much less to teach
another how it is to be done. And if,
by writing to one who understands a Lan-
guage, it be thus difficult to give Instru-
ctions, how, without the Help of Hear-
ing, he must utter those Sounds, it must
needs increase the Difficulty, when there
is no other Language to express it in, but
that of Dumb Signs.

These Difficulties (of which I was well
aware) did not yet so far discourage me
from that Undertaking, but that I did still
conceive it possible that both Parts of this
Task might be effected.

As to the First of them; Tho' I did not
doubt but that the Ear doth as much guide
the Tongue in Speaking, as the Eye doth
the Hand in Writing, or Playing on the
Lute; and therefore those who by Acci-
dent do wholly, lose their Hearing, lose al-
so their Speech, and consequently become
Dumb as well as Deaf, (for it is in a
manner the same Difficulty for one that
Hears not, to speak well, as for him that
is Blind, to write a fair Hand). Yet since
we see that 'tis possible for a Lady to at-
tain so great a Dexterity, as, in the Dark,
to play on a Lute, though to that Va-
riety of nimble Motions, the Eyes Dire-
ction, as well as the Judgment of the Ear,
might seem necessary to guide the Hand;
I did not think it impossible, but that the
Organs of Speech might be taught to ob-
serve their due Postures, though neither
the Eye behold their Motion, nor the Ear
discern the Sound they make.

And as to the other, that of Language,
might seem yet more possible: For since
that in Children, every Day the Know-
ledge of Words, with their various Con-
structions and Significations, is by degrees
attain'd by the Ear, so that in a few Years
they arrive to a competent Ability of ex-
pressing themselves in their First Language,
at least as to the more usual Parts and No-
tions of it, why should it be thought
impossible that the Eye (though with
some Disadvantage) might as well apply
such Complication of Letters, or other
Characters, to represent the various Con-
ceptions of the Mind, as the Ear, a like
Complication of Sounds? For though,
as things now are, it be very true that
Letters are, with us, the immediate Chara-
cters of Sounds, as those of Sounds are of
Conceptions, yet is there nothing, in the
Nature of the Thing it self, why Letters
and Characters might not as properly be
applied to represent immediately, as by
the Intervention of Sounds, what our Con-
ceptions are.

Which is so great a Truth, (though
not so generally taken Notice of) that
'tis practiced every Day; not only of the
Chineses, whose whole Language is said
to be made up of such Characters as to
represent Things and Notions indepen-
dent on the Sound of Words; and is there-
fore indifferently spoken by those who
differ not in the Writing of it; (like as
what, in Figures, we write 1, 2, 3, for
One, Two, Three; a Frenchman, for Ex-
ample, reads Un, Deux, Trois) But, in
Part, also amongst our selves; as in the
Numeral Figures now mentioned, and ma-
ny other Characters of Weights and Me-
tals, used indifferently by divers Nations
to signifie the same Conceptions, though
expressed by a different Sound of Words;
and more frequently in the Practice of
Specious Arithmetick, and Operations of
Algebra, expressed in such Symbols, as so
little need the intervention of Words to
make known their Meaning, that, when
different Persons come to express, in Words
the Sense of those Characters, they will as
little agree upon the same Words, tho'
all express the same Sense as Two Transla-
tors of one and the same Book into ano-
ther Language.

And though I will not dispute the Pra-
ctical Possibility of introducing, an Univer-
sal Character, in which all Nations, tho'
of different Speech, shall express their
common Conceptions; yet that some Two
or Three (or more) Persons may, by Consent,
agree upon such Characters, whereby to ex-
press each to other their Sense in Writing,
without attending the Sound of Words, is
so far from an Impossibility, that it must
needs be allowed to be very Feasible if
not Facile. And if it may be done by new
invented Characters, why not as well by
those already in use? Which though to
those who know their common Use may
signifie Sounds; yet to those who know it
not, or do not attend it, may be as imme-
diately applied to signifie Things or Noti-
ons, as if they signified nothing else; and
so long as it is purely Arbitrary by what
Character to express such a Thing or No-
tion, we may as well make use of that
Character or Collection of Letters, to ex-
press the Thing to the Eyes of him that is
Deaf, by which others express the Sound
or Name of it to those that Hear. So that
indeed that shall be to him a real Chara-
cter, which expresseth to another a Vocal
Sound, but signifieth to both the same
Conception; which is to understand the
Language.

To these Fundamental Grounds of Pos-
sibility in Nature, I may next add a Con-
sideration which made me think it Moral-
ly possible; that is, not impossible to suc-
ceed in Practice. And because I am now
giving an Account to One who is so good
a Friend to Mathematicks, and Profi-
cient therein, I shall not doubt but this
Consideration will have the Force of a
great Suasive. Considering therefore from
how few and despicable Principles the
whole Body of Geometry, by continual
Consequence, is inforced; if so fair a Pile,
and curious Structure, may be rais'd, and
stand fast upon so small a Bottom, I could
not think it incredible, that we might at-
tain some considerable Success in this De-
sign, how little soever we had first to be-
gin upon; and from those little Actions
and Gestures, which have a kind of Na-
tural Significancy in them, we might, if
well managed, proceed gradually to the
Explication of a Compleat Language, and
withal direct to those Curiosities of Moti-
on and Posture in the Organs of Speech,
requisite to the Formation of a Sound de-
sired, and, so to effect both Parts of what
we intend.

My next Inducement to undertake it,
was a Consideration of the Person (which,
in a Work of this Nature, is of no small
Concernment) who was represented to
me as very Ingenious and Apprehensive,
(and therefore a very fit Subject to make
an Essay upon) and so far at least a Ma-
thematician as to draw Pictures; wherein,
I was told he had attain'd so good Ability,
which did induce me to believe that he
was not uncapable of the Patience, which
will be necessary to attend the Curiosity of
those little Varieties in the Articulation of
Sounds, being already accustomed to ob-
serve and imitate those little Niceties in
a Face, without which it is not possible to
Draw a Picture well.

I shall add this also, That, once, he could
have spoken, though so long ago that (I
think) he doth scarce remember it. But
having, by Accident, when about Five
Years of Age, lost his Hearing, he conse-
quently lost his Speech also; not all at
once, but by degrees, in about half a
Year's Time: Which though it do con-
firm what I was saying but now, how need-
ful it is for the Ear to guide the Tongue
in Speaking, (since that Habit of Speak-
ing, which was attain'd by Hearing, was
lost with it) and might therefore discou-
rage the Understanding; yet I was there-
by very much secured, that his Want of
Speech was but a Consequent of his Want
of Hearing, and did not proceed original-
ly from an Indisposition in the Organs of
Speech to form those Sounds. And tho'
the Neglect of it in his younger Years,
when the Organs of Speech being yet ten-
der, were more pliable, might now render
them less Capable of that Accurateness
which those of Children attain unto,
(whereof we have daily Experience, it
being found very difficult, if not impossi-
ble, to teach a Foreigner well in Years the
Accurate Pronouncing of that Sound of
Language, which, in his tender Years, he
had not learned) yet if he can attain to
speak but so well, as a Foreigner, at his
Years, may learn to speak English; what
shall be farther wanting to that Accurate-
ness which a Native from his Childhood
attains unto, may, to an indifferent Esti-
mate, be very well dispenced with?

Having thus acquainted you with those
Considerations which did induce me to at-
tempt it, lest you may think I build too
confidently there upon, and judge me guil-
ty of too much Vanity, in promising my
self a greater Success than can in Reason
be hoped for, it will next be necessary to
give you some Account what Measure of
Success I might propose to my self as pro-
bable in such an Undertaking.

And as to the First Part of it, (that of
Speaking) though I did believe, that much
more is to be Effected than is commonly
thought Feasible; and that it was possible
for him so to speak as to be understood;
yet I cannot promise my self that he shall
speak so Accurately, but that a Critical
Ear may easily discern some Failures, or
little Differences from the ordinary Tone
or Pronunciation of other Men; (since
that we see the like every Day, when not
Foreigners only, but those of our own
Nation in the remoter Parts of it, can
hardly speak so Accurately, as not to dis-
cover a considerable Difference from what
is the common Dialect or Tone at London.)
And this not only upon the Consideration
last mentioned, concerning the Organs, of
Speech less pliable to those Sounds to
which they were not from the First accu-
stomed) but especially upon that other
Consideration, concerning the Ears Useful-
ness to guide and correct the Tongue. For
as I doubt not but that a Person who knows
well how to Write, may attain by Custom
such a Dexterity as to Write in the Dark
tolerably well, yet it could not be expect-
ed that he should perform it with the same
Elegancy as if he saw the Motions of his
Hands; so neither is it reasonable to be
expected, that he who cannot Hear, tho'
he may know how to Speak truly, should
yet perform it so Accurately as if he had
the Advantage of his Ear also.

Nor can I promise, nor indeed hope,
that how Accurately soever he may learn
to Speak, he should be able to make so
great Use of it as others do. For since
that he cannot Hear what others say to
him, as well as express his own Thoughts
to them, he cannot make such Use of it
in Discourse as others may. And though
it may be thought possible that he may in
Time discern by the Motion of the Lips,
visible to the Eye, what is said to him,
(of which I am loth to deliver a positive
Judgment, since much may be said conje-
cturally both Ways), yet this cannot be
expected, till at least he be so perfectly
Master of the Language, as that, by a
few Letters known, he may be able to sup-
ply the rest of the Word; and by a few
Words, the rest of the Sentence, or at least
the Sense of it, by a probable Conjecture,
(as when we Decipher Letters written in
Cipher) For, that the Eye can actually
discern all the Varieties of Motion in the
Organs of Speech, and see what Sounds
are made by these Motions, (of which
many are inward, and are not expos'd to
the Eye at all) is not imaginable.

But as to the other Branch of our De-
sign, concerning the Understanding of a
Language, I see no Reason at all to doubt,
but that he may attain This, as perfectly as
those that Hear; and that, allowing the
like Time and Exercise, as to other Men
is requisite to attain the Perfection of a
Language, and the Elegance of it, he may
Understand as well, and Write as good
Language as other Men; and (abating
only what doth directly depend upon
Sound, as Tones, Cadencies, and such
Punctilio's) no whit inferior to what he may
attain to, if he had his Hearing as others
have. And what I speak of him in parti-
cular, I mean as well of any other Ingeni-
ous Person in his Condition; who, I be-
lieve, might be taught to use their Book
and Pen as well as others, if a right Course
were taken to that Purpose.

To tell you next, what Course I have
hitherto used towards this Design, it will
not be so necessary. For should I descend to
Particulars, it would be too tedious; es-
pecially since they are to be used very in-
differently, and varied as the present Case
and Circumstance do require; and as to
the General Way, it is sufficiently intima-
ted, already.

As to that of Speech, I must first, by
the most significant Signs I can, make him
to understand in what Posture and Motion
I would have him apply his Tongue, Lips,
and other Organs Of Speech, to the form-
ing of such a Sound as I direct. Which
if I hit right, I confirm him in it, if he
miss, I signifie to him in what he differed
from my Direction, and to what Circum-
stances he must attend to mend it. By
which Means, with some Trials and a
little Patience, he learns first One, then
another Sound; and, by frequent repeti-
tions, is confirm'd in it; or (if he chance
to forget) recovers it again.

And for this Work I was so far prepa-
red beforehand, that I had heretofore,
upon another Occasion, (in my Treatise
De Loquela, prefixed to my Grammar for
the English Tongue) considered very ex-
actly (what few Attend to) the Accurate
Formation of all Sounds in Speaking, (at
least as to our own Language, and those I
knew) without which it were in vain to
set upon the Task. For if we do not know,
or not consider, how we Apply our own Or-
gans in forming those Sounds we speak, it
is not likely, that we shall, this Way Teach
another.

As to that of Teaching him the Lan-
guage, I must, (as Mathematicians do
from a few Principles first granted) from
that little Stock (that we have to begin
upon) of such Actions and Gestures as have
a kind of Natural Significancy, or some
few Signs, which himself had before ta-
ken up to express his Thoughts as well as
he could, Proceed to Teach him what I
mean by somewhat else; and so, by Steps,
to more and more; And this, so far as
well I can, in such Methods, as that what
he knows already may be a Step to what
he is next to learn; as in Mathematicks,
we make use, not of Principles only, but
Propositions already demonstrated, in the
Demonstration of that which follows.

It remains now, for the Perfecting the
Account which at present you desire of me,
only to tell you, what progress we have al-
ready made; which had not your Desires
commanded from me, I should have re-
spited a while longer, till I might have
made it somewhat Fuller.

He hath been already with me somewhat
more than Two Months, in which Time,
though I cannot be thought to have Fi-
nished such a Work, yet the Success is not
so little as to Discourage the Undertaking,
but as much as I could hope for in so short
a Time, and more than I did expect; So
that I may say, the greatest Difficulty of
both Parts being almost over, what Re-
mains, is little more than the Work of
Time and Exercise. There is hardly any
Word, which (with Deliberation) he can-
not speak; but to do it Accurately, and
with Expedition, we must allow him the
Practice of some considerable Time, to
make it familiar to him.

And, as to the Language, though it were
very indifferent to him, who knew none,
which to begin withal; yet since it is out
of Question, that English, to him, is like
to be the most Useful and Necessary, it
was not adviseable to begin with any other.
For though he can pronounce the Latin
with much more Ease, (as being less per-
plexed with a Multitude of concurring
Consonants) yet this is a Consideration of
much less Concernment than the other.

To this therefore having apply'd him-
self, he hath already Learned a great ma-
ny Words, and, I may say, a considerable
Part of the English as to Words of most
frequent Use: But the whole Language
being so Copious, tho' otherwise Easie,
will require a longer Time to perfect what
he hath begun.

And this, Sir, is the full History of our
Progress hitherto. If you shall hereafter
esteem our future Success worthy your ta-
king notice of, you may command that, or
what else is within the Power, of

SIR, Your Honour's
very Humble Servant,
JOHN WALLIS.

Oxford,
March 14.
1664


The following Account was Writ
by the late Ingenious Mr. Ol-
denburg, Secretary of the
Royal Society,

THE, Person, to whom the foregoing
Letter doth refer, is Mr. Daniel
Whaley, (Son of Mr. ....... Whaley, late
of Northampton, and Mayor of that Town)
He was (soon after the Date of this Let-
ter) on the 21st of May 1662, present at
a Meeting of the Royal Society, (of which
the Register of that Day's Proceedings
takes particular Notice) and did in their
Presence, to their great Satisfaction, pro-
nounce distinctly enough such Words as
by the Company were proposed to him;
and though not altogether with the usual
Tone or Accent, yet so as easily to be un-
derstood: Whereupon also the said Do-
ctor was, by the same Assembly, encou-
raged to pursue what he had so ingeniously
and successfully begun. About the same
Time also (his Majesty having heard of
it, and being willing to see him) he did
the like several Times at Whitehall, in the
Presence of His Majesty, his Hignness
Prince Rupert, and divers others of the
Nobility, tho' he had then employ'd but a
small Time in acquiring this Ability. In
the Space of One Year, which was the
whole Time of his Stay with Dr. Wallis,
he had read over a great Part of the Eng-
lish Bible, and had attain'd so much Skill,
as to express himself intelligibly in ordina-
ry Affairs; to understand Letters written
to him, and to write Answers to them,
tho' not Elegantly, yet so as to be under-
stood; and in the Presence of many Fo-
reigners (who out of Curiosity have come
to see him) hath oft-times not only read
English and Latin to them, but pronoun-
ced the most difficult Words of their Lan-
guages (even Polish it selfj which they
could propose to him. Since that Time,
tho' he hath not had Opportunity of ma-
king much farther Improvement, for want
of an Instructor, yet he doth yet retain
what he had attain'd to; or wherein he
may have forgot the Niceness requisite in
the Pronunciation of some Sounds, doth
easily recover it with a little Help.

Nor is this the only Person on whom
the said Doctor hath shewed the Effect of
his Skill, but he hath since done the like
for another, (a young Gentleman of a ve-
ry good Family and a fair Estate) who
did from his Birth want his Hearing. On
this Occasion I thought it very suitable to
give Notice of a small Latin Treatise, ef
this same Author, first Published in the
Year 1653, intituled De Loquela, [of
Speech] prefixed to his Grammar of the
English Tongue, written also in Latin. In
which Treatise of Speech, (to which he
refers in this Discourse, and on Confidence
of which he durst undertake that difficult
Task) he doth very distinctly lay down
the Manner of Forming all Sounds off Let-
ters usual in Speech, as well of the Eng-
lish as of other Languages; which is, I
think, the First Book ever Published of
that Kind; (for tho' some Writers for-
merly have here and there occasionally
said something of the Formation of some
particular Lettets, yet none, that I know
of, had before him undertaken to give an
Account of all.) Whether any since him
have with more Judgment and Accurate-
ness performed the same, I will not take
upon me to determine. In his Grammar
of the English Tongue, (to which this of
[1] Speech is prefixed) he hath so briefly
and clearly given an Account of this Lan-
guage, as may be very Advantageous, not
only to Strangers, for the easie Attain-
ment thereof, but even to the English them-
selves, for the clear Discovering (which
few take Notice of) the true Genius of
their own Language.

[1] A Translation of this Treatise _Of Speech_, as
likewise of the Grammar, with some considerable and
useful Additions, is pre-
paring for the Press; the Whole will be looked over by several Learn-
ed Men, both of Town and the Universities. If any Gentlemen that
have made Observations on the English Tongue, will be pleas'd to
communicate them to the Bookseller, they shall be carefully inserted
in their proper Places.


A Letter of Dr. John Wallis,
(Geom. Prof. Oxon, and F.
R.S.) to Mr. Thomas Be-
verly, concerning his Method
for instructing Persons Deaf
and Dumb.

SIR,

I Have receiv'd your Letter of Sept. 22.
wherein you tell me the Case of a Fa-
mily, wherein you are concern'd;
which is really very sad. Of Eight Chil-
dren now living, Five are Deaf and Dumb.
(And, I suppose, Dumb because Deaf).

You desire my Directions, how best to
supply that Defect: Having had some
Acquaintance (I understand) with Mr.
Alexander Popham, (who, I think, is yet
living) whom (being Born Deaf) I taught
(about Four or Five and Thirty Years ago)
to speak distinctly, (though I doubt he
may now have forgot much of it) and to
understand a Language, so as to express
his Mind (tolerably well) by Writing,
and to understand what is written to him
by others. As I had, before, taught Mr.
Daniel Whaley: Who was Deaf also;
but is lately dead.

Others, who were not Deaf, but had
great Impediments in their Speech, (who
Stutter'd extremely, or who have not been
able to pronounce some Letters,) I have
taught to Speak, very Distinctly, and to
Pronounce those Letters which before they
could not: So as perfectly to Conquer
that Difficulty; at least so as that it was
very little (if at all) discernable.

Some other Deaf Persons, I have not
attempted teaching them to Speak; but
only so as (in good Measure) to under-
stand a Language, and to express their
Mind (tolerably well) in Writing. Who
have thereby attained a much greater
Measure of Knowledge in many Things,
than was thought attainable to Persons in
their Circumstances; and become capable
(upon farther Improvement) of such fur-
ther Knowledge as is attainable by Read-
ing.

The former Part of this Work (teach-
ing to Speak or to speak Plain) is to be
done, by Directing them to Apply their
Tongue, Lips, and other Organs of Speech,
to such Postures and Motions, as are pro-
per for the Formation of such and such
Sounds (respectively) as are used in Speech.
And, then, the Breath, emitted from the
Lungs, will Form those Sounds: whether
the Person Speaking do hear himself, or
not.

Of which respective Formation, of all
Sounds commonly used in Speech, I have
given a full Account (and, I think, I am
the First who have done it) in my Trea-
tise De Loquela; prefixed to my Grammar
of the English Tongue; first Published in
the Year 1653. In Pursuance of which,
I attempted the Teaching of Deaf Persons
to speak.

And this is indeed the shorter Work
of the Two. (However looked up-
on the more Stupendous.) But this,
without the other, would be of little
Use. For, to pronounce Words only as a
Parrot, without knowing what they signi-
fie, would do us but little Service. And
it would by Degrees (without a Director
to correct Mistakes) come to be lost in
Part. For, like as one who Writes a fair
Hand, if he become Blind, would soon
forget the exact Draught of his Letters,
for want of an Eye to direct his Hand:
So he, who doth not Hear himself Speak,
must needs be apt to forget the Niceness of
Formation, (without a Prompter) for
want of an Ear to regulate his Tongue.

The other Part of the Work (to teach
a Language) is what you now inquire a-
bout.

In order to this; it is Necessary in the
First Place, That the Deaf Person be
taught to Write. That there may be some-
what to express to the Eye, what the
Sound (of Letters) represents to the Ear.

'Twill next be very Convenient, (be-
cause Pen and Ink is not always at Hand)
that he be taught, How to design each Let-
ter, by some certain Place, Position, or
Motion of a Finger, Hand, or other Part
of the Body, (which may serve instead
of Writing.) As for Instance, The Five
Vowels a e i o u; by pointing to the Top
of the Five Fingers: And the other Let-
ters be d c d, &c. by such other Place or Po-
sture of a Finger, or otherwise, as shall be,
agreed upon.

After this; a Language is to be taught
this Deaf Person, by like Methods as Chil-
dren are at first taught a Language;, (tho'
the Thing perhaps be not heeded.) Only
with this Difference: Children learn
Sounds by the Ear; but the Deaf Person
is to learn Marks (of those Sounds) by,
the Eye. But both the one and the other,
do equally signifie the same Things or No-
tions; and are equally (significantia ad
placitum) of meer Arbitrary Significati-
on.

'Tis then most natural (as Children
learn the Names of Things) to furnish
him (by Degrees) with a Nomenclator;
containing a competent Number of Names
of Things common and obvious to the Eye;
(that you may shew the Thing answering
to such a Name.) And these digested un-
der convenient Titles; and placed (under
them) in such convenient Order, (in se-
veral Columnes, or other orderly Situati-
on in the Paper) as (by their Position)
best to express, to the Eye, their Relation
or Respect to one another. As Contraries
or Correlatives, one over against the other;
Subordinates of Appurtenances, under their
Principals. Which may serve as a kind of
Local Memory.

Thus, (in one Paper) under the Title
Mankind, may he placed (not Confused-
ly, but in Decent Order) Man, Woman,
Child, (boy, girl.) And, if you please,
the Names of some known Persons, (of
the Family, or others,) with Spaces left
to be supplied with other like Names or
Words, as after there may be Occasi-
on.

Then (in another Paper) under the Ti-
tle Body may be written (in like conve-
nient Order) head, (hair, skin, ear,)
Face, forehead, eye, (eye-lid, eyebrow,)
cheek, nose, (nostril,) mouth, (lip, chin.)
Neck, (throat.) Back, Breast, Side,
(right-side, left-side.) Belly, Shoulder,
Arm, (elbow, wrist, hand, (back, palm,))
finger, (thumb, knuckle, nail.) Thigh,
knee, leg, (shin, calf, anckle,) foot, (heel,
sole,) toe. With like Spaces, as before,
for more to be added, as there is Occasi-
on.

And when he hath learned the Import
of Words in each Paper, let him write
them (in like manner) in distinct Leaves
or Pages of a Book (prepared for that
purpose) to confirm his Memory, and to
have Recourse to it upon Occasion.

In a Third Paper, you may give him
the Inward Parts. As, Scul, (brain,)
throat, (windpipe, gullet,) stomach,
(guts,) heart, lungs, liver, splene, kidney,
bladder, (urine,) vein, (blood,) bone,
(marrow,) flesh, fat, &c.

In another Paper, under the Title Beast,
may be placed; Horse, (stone horse, geld-
ing,) mare, (colt.) Bull, (ox,) cow,
calf. Sheep, ram, (wether,) ew, (lamb.)
Hog, boar, sow, pig. Dog, (mastiff,
hound, grey-hound, spaniel) bitch, (whelp,
puppy.) Hare, rabbet. Cat, mouse,
rat, &c.

Under the Title Bird, or Fowl, put
Cock, (capon,) hen, chick. Goose, (gan-
der,) gosling. Duck, (drake,) Swan, Crow,
Kite, Lark, &c.

Under the Title Fish, put Pike, Eel,
Plaice, Salmon, Lobstar, Crab, Oister,
Crawfish, &c.

You may then put Plants or Vegetables
under several Heads, or Subdivisions of
the same Head. As, Tree, (root, body,
bark, bough, leaf, fruit,) Oak, ash, ap-
ple-tree, pear-tree, vine, &c. Fruit, ap-
ple, pear, plumb, cherry, grape, nut, o-
range, lemon. Flower; rose, tulip, gilo-
fer. Herb, (weed,) grass. Corn, wheat,
barly, rye, pea, bean.

And the like of Inanimates. As, Hea-
ven; sun, moon, star. Elements; earth,
water, air, fire. And (under the Title
Earth;) clay, sand, gravel, stone. Me-
tal; gold, silver, brass, (copper,) iron,
(steel,) lead, tin, (pewter,) glass. Un-
der the Title Water; put Sea, pond, ri-
ver, stream. Under that of Air; put
Light, dark, mist, fog. Cloud; wind,
rain, hail, snow; thunder, lightning,
rainbow. Under that of Fire; Coal,
flame, smoak, soot, ashes,

Under the Title Clothes; put Woollen,
(cloth, stuff,) Linnen; (Holland, lawn
lockarum) Silk, (Satin, Velvet.) Hat,
cap, band, doublet, breeches, coat, cloak,
flocking, shooe , boot, shirt, petticoat,
gown, &c.

Under the Title' House; put Wall,
roof, door, window, (casement,) room.

Under Room; put Shop, hall, parlour,
dining-room, chamber, (study, closet,)
kitchin, cellar, stable, &c.

And, under each of these, (as distinct
Heads,) the Furniture or Utensils belong-
ing thereunto; (with Divisions and Sub-
divisions, as there is Occasion;) which I
forbear to mention, that I be not too pro-
lix.

And, in like manner, from time to
time, may be added more Collections or
Classes of Names or Words, conveniently
digested under distinct Heads, and suit-
ble Distributions; to be written in di-
stinct Leaves or Pages of his Book; in such
Order as may seem convenient: Which I
leave to the Prudence of the Teacher.

When he is furnished with a competent
Number of Names, (though not so many
as I have mentioned:) it will be seasona-
ble to teach him (under the Titles Singu-
lar, Plural,) the Formation of Plurals
from Singulars; by adding s or es. As,
Hand, hands; Face, faces; Fish, fishes;
&c. with some few Irregulars; As, Man,
Men; Woman, women; Foot, feet; Tooth,
teeth; Mouse, mice; Lowse, lice.; Ox,
Oxen, &c.

Which (except the Irregulars) will
serve for Possessives (to be after taught
him,) which are formed from their Pri-
mitives, by like Addition of s or es. Ex-
cept some few Irregulars; As My, mine;
Thy, thine; Our, ours; Your, yours; His,
her, hers; Their, theirs, &c.

And in all those, and other like Cases,
it will be proper first to shew him the
Particulars, and then the General Ti-
tle.

Then teach him (in another Page, or
Paper) the Particles; A, an; The, this,
that; These, those.

And the Pronouns; I, me, my, mine;
Thou, thee, thy, thine; We, us, our, ours;
Ye, you, your, yours; He, him, his; She,
her, hers; It, its; They, them, their,
theirs; Who, whom, who's.

Then, under the Titles Adjective, Sub-
stantive; teach him to connect these. As,
My hand, Your head, His foot, His feet,
Her arm, arms, Our hats, Their shoes,
John's coat, William's hand, &c

And, in order to furnish him with more
Adjectives; Under the Title Colours, you
may place Black, white, gray, green, blue,
yellow, red, &c. And, having shewed the
Particulars, let him know, These are cal-
led Colours.

The like for Taste, and Smell; As,
Sweet, bitter, soure, stink.

And for Hearing; Sound, noise, word.

Then, for Touch or Feeling; Hot,
(warm,) Cold, (cool,) Wet, (moist,)
Dry; Hard, soft; Tough, brittle; Hea-
vy, light, &c.

From whence you may furnish him
with more Examples of Adjectives with
Substantives; As, White bread, Brown
bread, Green grass, Soft cheese, Hard
cheese, Black hat, my black bat, &c.

And then, inverting the Order, Sub-
stantive and Adjective (with the Verb Co-
pulative between:) As; Silver is white;
Gold is yellow; Lead is heavy; Wood is
light; Snow is white; Ink is black; Flesh
is soft; Bone is hard; I am sick; I am
not well, &c. Which will begin to give
him some Notion of Syntax.

In like manner, when Substantive and
Substantive are so connected. As; Gold is
a Metal; A Rose is a Flower; We are
Men; They are Womn; Horses are
Beasts; Geese are Fowl; Larks are
Birds, &c.

Then, as those before relate to Quality,
you may give him some other Words rela-
ting to Quantity. As, Long, short; Broad,
narrow; Thick, thin; High (tall,) low,
Deep, shallow; Great, (big,) small, (li ti-
tle;) Much, little; Many, few; Full,
empty; Whole, part, (piece;) All, some,
none; Strong, weak; Quick, slow; Equal,
unequal; Bigger, less.

Then, Words of Figure; As, Streight,
crooked; Plain, bowed; Concave, (hollow)
convex; Round, square, three-square;
Sphere, (globe, ball, boul) Cube, (die,)
Upright, sloping; Leaning forward, lean-
ing backward; Like, unlike.

Of Gesture; As, Stand, lye, sit, kneel,
stoop.

Of Motion; As, Move, (stir,) rest;
Walk, (go, come;) Run; Leap; Ride;
Fall, rise; Swim, sink, (drown;) Slide;
Creep, (crawl;) Fly; Pull, (draw,) thrust,
throw; Bring, fetch, carry.

Then, Words relating to Time, Place,
Number, Weight, Measure, Money, &c.
are (in convenient time) to be shewed
him distinctly. For which the Teacher,
according to his Discretion, may-take a
convenient Season.

As likewise, the Time of the Day; The
Days of the Week; The Days of the Month;
The Months of the Year; and other things
relating to the Almanack. Which he will
quickly be capable to understand, if once
Methodically shewed him.

As likewise, the Names and Situations,
of Places, and Countries, which are con-
venient for him to know. Which may
be orderly written in his Book; and shew-
ed him in Maps of London, England, Eu-
rope, the World, &c.

But these may he done at leisure; As
likewise the Practice of Arithmetick, and
other like pieces oi Learning.

In the mean Time, (after the Concord
of Substantive and Adjective,) he is to be
shewed (by convenient Examples) that
of the Nominative and Verb. As for In-
stance, I go, You see, He sits, They stand,
the Fire burns, the Sun shines, the Wind
blows, the Rain falls, the Water runs;
and the like: with the Titles in the Top,
Nominative, Verb.

After this (under the Titles, Nomina-
tive, Verb, Accusative,) give him Exam-
ples of Verbs Transitives; As, I see you,
You see Me, The Fire burns the Wood, The
Boy makes a Fire, The Cook roasts the
Meat, The Butler lays the Cloth, We eat
our Dinner.

Or even with a Double Accusative; as
You teach me (Writing, or) to write;
John teacheth me to Dance; Thomas tells
me a Tale, &c.

After this; you may teach him the
Flexion or Conjugation of a Verb; or wbat
is equivalent thereunto. For, in our Eng-
lish Tongue, each Verb hath but Two Ten-
ses, (the Present and the Preter) and
Two Participles, (the Active and the Pas-
sive.) All the rest is performed by Au-
xiliaries. Which (Auxiliaries) have no
more Tenses, than the other Verbs.

Those Auxiliaries are, Do, did; Will,
would; Shall, should; May, might; Can,
could; Must, ought to; Have, had; Am,
(be,) Was. And if, by Examples, you
can insinuate the signification of these Few
Words: you have taught him the whole
Flexion of the Verb.

And here it will be convenient, (once
for all,) to write him out a full Para-
digm of some one Verb, (suppose, to See,)
through all those Auxiliaries.

The Verb it self, hath but these Four
Words to be learned; See, saw, seeing,
seen. Save that, after Thou in the Second
Person singular (in both Tenses) we add
est; and in the Third Person singular (in
the Present Tense) eth or es: Or, in-
stead thereof, st, th, s. And so in all
Verbs.

Then, to the Auxiliaries, Do did, Will
would, Shall should, May might, Can could,
Must, ought to, we adjoin the Indefinite
See. And, after Have had, Am (be) was,
the Passive Participle Seen. And so for
all other Verbs.

But the Auxiliary Am or Be, is some-
what Irregular; in a double Form;

Am, art, is; Plural, Are. Was, wast,
was; Plural, Were.

Be, beest, be; Plural, Be. Were, wert,
were; Plural, Were.

Be (am,) was, being, been.

Which (attended with the other Aux-
iliaries) make up the whole Passive Voice.

All Verbs (without Exception) in the
Active Participle, are formed by adding
ing; As, See, seeing; Teach, Teaching, &c.

The Preter Tense, and the Passive Par-
ticiple, are formed (regularly) by adding
ed. But are oft subject to Contractions,
and other Irregularities, (sometime, the
same in both; sometime, different.) And
therefore it is convenient, here, to give a
Table of Verbs (especially the most usu-
al) for those Three Cases. (Which
may, at once, teach their Signification,
and Formation,) As, Boil, boiled, boiled;
Rost, rosted, rosted; Bake, baked, baked,
&c. Teach, taught, taught; Bring, brought,
brought; Buy, bought, bought, &c. See,
saw, seen; Give, gave, given; Take, took,
taken; Forsake, forsook, forsaken; Writ,
wrote, written, &c. With many more, fit
to be learned.

The Verbs being thus dispatched; he is
then to learn the Prepositions. Wherein
lies the whole Regimen of the Noun.
(For Diversity of Cases we have none.)
The force of which is to be insinuated by
convenient Examples, suited to their diffe-
rent Significations. As, for instance,

Of, A piece of bread; A pint of Wine;
The cover of a pot; The colour of gold;
A ring of gold; A cup of Silver; the
Mayor of London; The longest of all, &c.

And in like manner for, Off; on, upon;
To, unto, till, until; From; At; In
(within,) out (without;) Into, out of;
About, over, under; Above, below; Be-
tween, among; Before, behind, after; For,
By; With, through; against; Concerning;
And by this Time, he will be pretty well
inabled to understand a Single Sentence.

In the last Place; he is (in like man-
ner) to be taught Conjuncticns. (Which
serve to connect, not Words only, but, Sen-
tences.) As, And, also, Likewise; Either,
or, whether; Neither, nor; If, when;
Why, (Whefore,) because, therefore;
But, through, yet, &c. And these illustra-
ted by convenient Examples, in each Case,
As,

Because I am cold; therefore I go to
the Fire; that I may be warm; For it is
cold Weather.

If it were fair, then it would be good
walking: But (however) though it rain,
yet I must go; because I promised. With
other like Instances.

And, by this time, his Book, (if well
furnished with plenty of Words; and
those well digested, under several Heads,
tod in good Order; and well recruited,
from time to time, as new Words occur;)
will serve him In the Nature of a Dictio-
nary and Grammar.

And, in Case the Deaf Person be other-
wise of a good Natural Capacity; and
the Teacher of a good Sagacity; By this
Method (proceeding gradually, step by
step,) you may (with Diligence and due
Application, of Teacher and Learner,) in
a Year's Time, or thereabouts, perceive a
greater Progress than you would expect:
and a good Foundation laid for further In-
struction, in Matters of Religion, and other
Knowledge which may be taught by Books.

It will be convenient, all along, to have
Pen, Ink and Paper ready at Hand, to write
down in Words, what you signifie to him
by Signs; and cause Him to write, (or
shew him how to write) what He signi-
fies by Signs. Which way (of signify-
ing their Mind by Signs) Deaf persons
are often very good at. And we must en-
deavour to learn their Language, (if I
may so call it) in order to teach them
ours: By shewing what Words answer
to their Signs.

'Twill be convenient also, as you go a-
long, (after some convenient progress
made) to express (in as plain Language
as may be) the import of some of the
Tables. As, for instance,

The Head is the Highest part of the
Body; the Feet, the Lowest part; The
Face is the Fore-part of the Head; The
Forehead is Over the Eyes; The Cheeks are
Under the Eyes; The Nose is Between the
Cheeks; The Mouth is Under the Nose,
and Above the Chin, &c.

And such plain Discourse, put into
Writing, and particularly explain'd; will
teach him by Degrees to understand Plain
Sentences. And like Advantages, a Saga-
cious Teacher, may take as Occasion of-
fers it self from time to time.

Thus I have, in a long Letter, given
you a Short Account of my Methods,
(used, in such Cases, with good Success)
which to do at Large, would require a
Book.

I have taken the pains to draw up this
Method, (which is what I have pursued
my self in the like Case,) as appprehend-
ing it may be of use to some others when I
am dead. And I am not desirous it should
die with me.

And I have done it as plainly as I could
that it may be the better understood.

I have given only some short Specimens
of such Tables as I had made for my own
Use, and the Use of those whom I was to
instruct; but to give them at large, would
be more than the Work of a Letter; and
they are to be varied, as the Circumstan-
ces of the Persons, and the Places may re-
quire, or the Prudence of a Teacher shall
find expedient.

It is adjusted to the English Tongue, be-
cause such were the Persons I had to deal
with.

To those of another Language, it must
be so altered as such Language requires.
And perhaps will not be so easily done
for another Language as for the Eng-
UJh. The Flexion of Nouns, the Conjuga-
tion of Verbs, the Difference of Genders,
the Variety of Syntax, &c. doth in other
Languages give a great deal of Trouble,
which the Simplicity of our Language
doth free us from. But this is not my
present Business.

I Am

SIR,

Yours to Serve You,

JOHN WALLIS.
